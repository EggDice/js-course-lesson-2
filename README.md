Roman numeral converter
-----------------------

Write a converter in JavaScript, which takes an integer end returns
the roman numeral representation in a string.

Process:
- Fork the repository
- clone it to your computer
- Run: `npm install` in the project directory
- The function is defined in the `index.js` file
- Run: `npm test` for running unit tests
- The unit tests are pre-written in the test directory,
  but they are commented out.

Happy coding, and don't forget your semicolons!
